## Anonion - Get unbiased opinions from your circle anonymously

Anonion is an anonymous opinion sharing platform that lets you ask anything to your friends, families, colleagues, etc, and receive responses from them anonymously.

People often feel hesitant to say something. We are insecure to share our deep secrets. We fear being judged for opening up. We do not want anyone to know our wild fantasies. Anonion makes it easy for people to open up in these scenarios.
